Config files heavily based off of Jonhoo's [config](https://github.com/jonhoo/configs/tree/master).

These files are managed with GNU Stow. I have each top-level directory representing config files for different devices and their requirements. Mainly light-weight is if you don't need fancy lsp but just want themes and basic keymaps.

```console
stow -t ~ -Sv <type>
```
